## Mod System

### Creating a Mod
1. Create a folder in `mods/` with your mod name
2. Create `mod.json` with metadata:
```json
{
  "name": "Your Mod Name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "description": "What your mod adds",
  "enabled": true
}
```
3. Add any data files you want to modify:
   - `bosses.json` - New or override bosses
   - `areas.json` - New areas or area changes
   - `items.json` - New items
   - `dungeons.json` - New dungeons
   - `dialogues.json` - Dialogue text
   - Any other data files from `data/`

### How Mods Load
- Base game data loads first from `data/`
- Enabled mods load sequentially, merging data
- Arrays (dungeons) are extended with new entries
- Objects (items, bosses) are updated/overridden
- Mod data takes precedence over base data for same IDs
